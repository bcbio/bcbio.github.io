<p>I've recently moved positions to the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/bioinfocore/">bioinformatics core at Harvard School of Public Health</a>. It's a great place to do science, with plenty of researchers doing interesting work and actively looking for bioinformatics collaborators. The team, working alongside members of the <a href="http://web.me.com/winhide/Win_Hide_Lab/Home.html">Hide Lab</a>, is passionate about open source work. Both qualities made it a great fit for my interests and experience.</p>
<p>My new group is currently hiring bioinformatics researchers. The work involves interacting collaboratively with a research group to understand their biological problem, creatively attacking the mountains of data underlying the research question, and presenting the results back in an intuitive fashion. On the programming side, it's an opportunity to combine existing published toolkits with your own custom algorithms and approaches. On the biology side, you should be passionate and interested in thinking of novel ways to advance our understanding of the problems. Practically, all of this work will involve a wide range of technologies and approaches; I expect plenty of next-generation sequencing data and lots of learning about the best ways to scale analyses.</p>
<p>Our other goal is to build re-usable tools for the larger research community. We work extensively with analysis frameworks like <a href="http://usegalaxy.org">Galaxy</a> and open standards like <a href="http://isatab.sourceforge.net/">ISA-Tab</a>. We hope to extract the common parts from disparate experiments to build abstractions that help get new analyses done quicker. Tool building also involves automating and deploying analysis pipelines in a way that allows biologists to run them directly. By democratizing analyses and presenting results to researchers at a high level they can directly interact with, science is accelerated and the world becomes an awesomer place.</p>
<p>So if you enjoy the work I write about here, and have always secretly wanted to sit in an office right next to me, now is your big chance (no stalkers, please). If this sounds of interest, please get in touch and I'd be happy to pass along more details.</p>
