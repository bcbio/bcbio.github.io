<p>
The <a href="http://www.biosql.org/wiki/Main_Page">BioSQL</a> project provides a well thought out relational database schema for storing biological sequences and annotations. For those developers who are responsible for setting up local stores of biological data, BioSQL provides a huge advantage via reusability. Some of the best features of BioSQL from my experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available interfaces for several languages (via Biopython, BioPerl, BioJava and BioRuby).
  </li>
<li>Flexible storage of data via a key/value pair model. This models information in an extensible manner, and helps with understanding distributed key/value stores like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a> and <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>.
  </li>
<li>Overall data model based on GenBank flat files. This makes teaching the model to biology oriented users much easier; you can pull up a text file from NCBI with a sequence and directly show how items map to the database.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the usefulness of BioSQL for local relational data storage, I would like to see it move into the rapidly expanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud development community</a>. Tying BioSQL data storage in with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework">Web frameworks</a> will help researchers make their data publicly available earlier and in standard formats. As a nice recent example, George has a series of posts on using <a href="http://biorelated.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/bio-graphics-biosql-and-rails-part-1/">BioSQL with Ruby on Rails</a>. There have also been several discussions of the BioSQL mailing list around standard web tools and APIs to sit on top of the database; see <a href="http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biosql-l/2009-January/001464.html">this thread</a> for a recent example.</p>
<p>
Towards these goals, I have been working on a BioSQL backed interface for <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. Google App Engine is a Python based framework to quickly develop and deploy web applications. For data storage, Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/">Datastore</a> provides an object interface to a distributed scalable storage backend. Practically, App Engine has free hosting quotas which can scale to larger instances as demand for the data in the application increases; this will appeal to cost-conscious researchers by avoiding an initial barrier to making their data available.</p>
<p>
My work on this was accelerated by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation's move to apply for participation in <a href="http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2009">Google's Summer of Code</a>. OpenBio is a great community that helps organize projects like BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava and BioRuby. After writing up a <a href="http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_Code_2009#BioSQL_web_interface_and_API_on_Google_App_Engine">project idea</a> for BioSQL on Google App Engine in our application, I was inspired to finish a demonstration of the idea.</p>
<p>
I am happy to announce a simple demonstration server running a BioSQL based backend: <a href="http://biosqlweb.appspot.com/">BioSQL Web</a>. The source code is available from <a href="http://github.com/chapmanb/biosqlweb/tree/master">my git repository</a>. Currently the server allows uploads of GenBank formatted files and provides a simple view of the records, annotations and sequences. The data is stored in the Google Datastore with an <a href="http://github.com/chapmanb/biosqlweb/blob/183ea5fad91437a2d9a4524db5708f13865c3e9a/BioSQL/GAE/BioSQLModels.py">object interface</a> that mimics the BioSQL relational model.</p>
<p>
Future posts will provide more details on the internals of the server end and client interface as they develop. As always, feedback, thoughts and code contributions are very welcome.</p>
