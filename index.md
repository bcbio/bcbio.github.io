[Blue Collar Bioinformatics (bcbio)](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
is community-developed
[variant calling, RNA-seq and small RNA analysis](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contents/pipelines.html).
Rapid improvements in high throughput sequencing and associated analysis tools
requires continuous validation, benchmarking and tuning of analysis
infrastructure. All of this development work is pre-competitive and shared
across academic labs, start-ups and larger organizations, making it a great
space for open, collaborative work. It's the raw input to the important science
we want to do: understand diverse populations, characterize disease mechanisms
and contribute to treatments.

This blog contains articles related to bcbio development, validation and the
open source bioinformatics community:
